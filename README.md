# Aircraft Database and Recommendation Engine

## Aircraft Database
[Link to database](aircraft_database)

This database is intended to be a sortable, filterable, and searchable database of all aircraft designs. While there are several other aircraft databases online, this is to my knowledge the only free database which can be filtered and sorted based on multiple aircraft characteristics. 

The values for the different aircraft characteristics were all scraped off of wikipedia, so there are bound to be some errors in the underlying dataset which carried through into this database.


## Recommendation Engine
(This section is still in development) 
This recommendation engine analyzes the content of aircraft wikipedia pages, along with the characteristics of the aircraft which were scraped and put into the database, to provide recommendations for similar aircraft to a given query.
